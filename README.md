```crystal
require "mime"
Mime.from_ext("jpg") # "image/jpeg"
Mime.from_ext("js")  # "application/javascript"
Mime.from_ext("jssssss")  # nil
```

### `Mime.to_ext(type)`
Read the first extension registered for a mime-type. Returns the extension as a string or `nil` is the mime-type is unknown.

```crystal
require "mime"
Mime.to_ext("image/jpeg") # "jpeg"
Mime.to_ext("application/javascript")  # "js"
```

Type files are pulled from the [node-mime](https://github.com/broofa/node-mime) project. To update the types.json file run
